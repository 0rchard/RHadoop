subject		rake-me - license?

Hi Alexander,

I am thinking about using rake-me at my company.  But, I just realize that I don't know what license your are using for the code.

Could you please add a license to github so your intentions are clear?

Hi Dale,

Like all my other software it's licensed under the BSD license. So you can use rake-me also in commercial projects.
